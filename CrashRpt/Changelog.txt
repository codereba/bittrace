======= Change History ========

--- Ver. 1.3.0 ---

- Added support of CMake - cross-plaform make system. Although CrashRpt doesn't support operating systems
  other than Windows, CMake makes it easier to maintain build configurations for different versions of Visual Studio.
  Project files for VC++ .NET 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010 and VC++ Express can be generated.

- Added instructions to the documentation on how to generate Visual Studio project files with CMake.

- Removed project files for Visual Studio 2003 (CrashRpt_v2003.sln) and Visual Studio 2005 (CrashRpt_v2005.sln). 
  To compile in VS2010, use Visual Studio 2010 project files (or use CMake to generate Visual Studio project 
  files for your favorite version of Visual Studio).

- Binary files now have version suffices (CrashRpt1300.dll, CrashRptProbe1300.dll and CrashSender1300.exe). This is
  to resolve problems of loading incorrect version of the DLL.

- Removed obsolete API InstallW, InstallA, Uninstall, AddFileW, AddFileA, GenerateErrorReport.

- Added an ability to select/deselect/delete all error reports and delete selected reports in ResendDlg (issue 112).

- Updated Italian lang file (issue 92).
- Updated German lang file (issue 98).

- Fixed: Wrong handling of dwFlags when setting handlers (issue 109)
- Fixed: SMTP fails if Date header missing (issue 110)

--- Ver. 1.2.10 ---

- Added new language files: German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Portuguese and Chinese Simplified.
  Some of these files were produced by professional translators (Korean, Chinese Simplified), but others
  are generated with help of an automated translation tool, so do not hesitate to report mistakes.

  is the same (bin) (issue 77).

- New function crAddScreenshot2() allows to define JPEG quality.

- Implemented Jpeg image preview in Error Report Details dialog.

- New section ScreenshotInfo in crash description XML file

- Modified compiler options in all projects to favor small size (Release configuration). This should

  restarts of an unstable application which crashes on start up. This is the enhancement requested 
  in issue 11.

  CR_INSTALL_INFO::uPriorities array.

  would need to configure SMTP transport without querying DNS MX (mail exchange) record.

--- Ver. 1.2.3 ---

- Improved file preview in DetailDlg. Now a file can be previewed in HEX or in text mode.

- Ability to customize the port for SMTP connection.

--- Ver. 1.2.2 ---

- WTL files are now included into CrashRpt distribution.

- Modifyed communication between CrashRpt.dll and CrashSender.exe. Now XML file is used for this purpose instead of named pipe.

- Refactored code. After crash, all complex actions are done outside of the crashed process (inside of CrashSender.exe).
  This includes taking desktop screenshot, minidump generation, file copying, file compression and sending.

- Introduced silent mode (CrashRpt sends report silently without showing GUI). 
  This is useful for services and server processes.

- Improved documentation (restyling).

- Introduced multi-part HTTP uploads. This will help to send large error reports more effectively.

--- Ver. 1.2.1 ---

- Refactored crash report generation and sending functionality. Now report files are stored 
  in unzipped state, compression is performed during sending procedure. This will be required for
  huge reports (that will be fully supported in the future).

- Added support of x64 platform (issue 7).

- Added an ability to make screenshots of the screen or the main app window on crash 
  through crAddScreenshot() function (issue 8).

- Ability to add custom text properties to the crash descriptor through crAddProperty() function    (issue 9).

- New function crAddFile2() improving the application-defined files addition.

- Ability to control which dbghelp.dll to use (issue 10).

- Ability to define the type of minidump (from normal size to huge size) (issue 10). 
  Contributed by crcode.s.
