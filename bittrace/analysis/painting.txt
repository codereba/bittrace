PAINTING PROCESS:
1.CALCULATE THE REGION TO PAINING.
2.SET THE CONTROLS OF THE REGIONS TO NEED REPAINT
3.SEND INVALID REGION NOTIFY THE WIN32 SUBSYSTEM.
4.RECEIVE PAINT MESSAGE,PROCESS: 
	(1) CALCULATE THE CONTROLS IN THE PAINT REGION.
	(2) REDRAW THE CONTROLS.
	
REDRAW DETAIL,HARD PROBLEM:
1.THE CONTAINED REGION MAYBE SCROLLED.
2.THE SUB CONTROLS IN ONE CONTROL MAYBE ADJUST SIZE AND POSITION.
3.THE CONTANT IN THE CONTROL MAYBE CHANGED.

TRAVERSE ALL CONTROL TO PAINTING WHOLE UI AND HAVE TOO MORE CONTROLS IS BAD PERFORMANCE REASON.

PAINTING METHOD:
1.EVERY CONTROL HAVE ITS OWN BITMAP.BUT MORE COMPLEX.
2.ONE SAVED BACK IMAGE,REUSED IT WHEN NOTHING CHANGED.

paining process design:

1 one control's content changed:
need paint controls:
1.this control

2.sub controls changed size or position:
1.all sub controls which is changed size or position.
2.container control

3.scrolled 
1.container control that's the owner of the scrollbar.
2.all sub control which have fixed location, becase all sub controls will changed they position when scrolled.

correct painting order:
1.first draw container control.
2.draw sub controls by its nature order later.

painting content:
the pixel matrix of this control.

painting content change mode:
1.containt changed, some pixel color changed.(and some special change:sizing etc.)
2.position changed, the position of the pixel matrix changed.

painting precisely:
1.locate the region exactly and which is must the smallest region which paint containt changed.
2.locate the controls directly.
3.draw the controls smallest, only draw the smallest region that painting containt changed.
