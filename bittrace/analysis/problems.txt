1.protect my file io:
  1.only these programs can access this file.
  2.if other program access this file,block it and record it.
  
  bittrace can do these.
  
2.record(collect) all io data,then make them togather to take a file.(be data on wire commonly).

so bittrace can do a lot of work to solve some problem i have,and i think other have too.
need to exam it.

problem have two layer.
layer 1,basically:
1.log all system event detail.

layer 2,advanced:
1.protection
2.record key log.
3.record,process data on io.
